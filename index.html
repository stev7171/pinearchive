        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Pine Archive is an effort to archive old ideas and projects from S&G Industries and their subsidiaries. All of the entries<br>
            in Pine Archive are either derived from stories told by former employees, or stories and ideas taken directly from the company.<br>
            Here at Pine Archive, we're working to bring you a better experience.<br><br>

            You can access the archive <a href="archive.html">here</a>!

            Back online! we've had some issues with hosting, and we had to relocate here. The old staff team we're sure you're used to will<br>
            be returning soon, but for now we're working on some back-end issues. Anyway, here's the news!<br><br>

            1. We've managed to strike a deal with Puppet Birds to be advertized on their show!<br>
            2. We've been having issues with sourcing information regarding our first entry, System 15B. If you have any information, please reach out.<br>
            3. We've managed to get someone at S&G to help with sourcing information from now on.<br><br>

            Thanks for reading, and we'll see you later!
