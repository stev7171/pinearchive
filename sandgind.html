        <p>
            Starting in 2019, S&G Industries quickly became a technologically advanced company. They made mechanical machine learning algorithms,<br>
            self-driving toy cars, and so much more. S&G soon started an offshute company, Stev Robotics, and began working on a big project, titled "The Nature Park Initiative".<br>
            The Nature Park Initiative, or just Nature Park, was an attempt to create a park with automoton performers and entertaining kinetic statues.<br>
            However, Nature Park ended in disaster. It's not known what actually happened, but whatever did happen ended in Stev Robotics being disbanded.<br><br>

            After this, S&G began working on a new show called "Puppet Birds", and built a facility out in the middle of nowhere where Puppet Birds would be filmed.<br>
            S&G created another offshute company named "Puppet Birds Enterprises" and filming of Puppet Birds began. However, there are several documented issues at the facility.<br>
            Primarily, one of the Puppet Birds they had apparently been testing on escaped and killed 5 people.<br><br>

            This is pretty much all of the knowledge we have right now, so this entry is currently being worked on.
