        <p>
            System 15B is supposedly a mechanical computer system, as indicated by internal documents and designs at S&G.<br>
            System 15B, according to an interview with an engineer from S&G, is actually a lot more complicated than any mechanical computation system<br>
            that is available to the general puiblic, as it was designed by some of the best when it comes to mechanical computation.<br>
            Based on that same interview, we actually have reason to believe that System 15B is some form of machine learning mechanism instead of a mechanical computer system,<br>
            but that isn't, and will probably never, be confirmed.<br><br>

            We are still looking into this, and S&G won't give up too much information, so as of currently this entry is not complete.
